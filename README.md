MOVIDA
======

MOVIDA is a new and innovative tool for the data management and analysis of non-invasive investigations in the Cultural Heritage field. The software was developed due to the lack of an adequate tool able to manage all the heterogeneous data generated in a in-situ multi-technique investigation of an artwork. It allows to directly manage, store analyse and perform cross-comparison of all the data obtained with the techniques usually employed in a scientific investigation of an artwork.
